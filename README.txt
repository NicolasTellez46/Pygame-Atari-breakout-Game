Hello, welcome to my game!

This game was created using Thonny and Pygames!

My game is a spin off of Atari breakout!
The goal of the game is to use the paddle and ball to break all the rainbow colored blocks above!
Once all the blocks are gone, the game will end. Depending on the users score the player will either
win if they have above 100 or lose if they have below 100. The player gains 10 points each time they
break a colored block, the player will lose 15 points each time they touch the redline at the bottom of
the screen. If the player wins, the win screen will display and if the player loses, the lose screen will play.
Some additional features are that the ball increases in speed each time it breaks a block and there's a pause button
that can be used to cheat the game if the player is having difficulty winning.
